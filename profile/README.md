# üêô usepolvo

**usepolvo** is an open-source API integration toolkit that simplifies the way developers interact with third-party services. It provides a unified, asynchronous interface for multiple APIs, handling the complexities of integration so you can focus on building features, not fighting with APIs.

## The Problem

When integrating multiple third-party APIs like Stripe, HubSpot, and Salesforce, developers often face:

- Inconsistent interfaces across different APIs
- Lack of native async support in many API clients
- Complex authentication and token management
- Varying rate limiting strategies
- Different pagination methods
- Frequent API versioning and changes
- The need for robust, API-specific error handling
- Building and maintaining separate webhook handlers

These challenges multiply with each new integration, increasing development time and technical debt.

## Our Solution

usepolvo streamlines API integrations by providing:

- **Unified Async API Interface**: Interact with all supported services using consistent, asynchronous methods and data structures.
- **Universal Async Support**: Enjoy non-blocking I/O operations for all integrations, even if the original API doesn't offer async capabilities.
- **Smart Authentication**: Automatic handling of various auth methods and secure token storage.
- **Built-in Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limit handling and retry logic across all integrations.
- **Universal Pagination**: Consistent data retrieval methods, regardless of the API's native approach.
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Common error types and handling across all integrations.
- **Webhook Management**: Unified webhook handling with built-in security and reliability features.
- **Efficient Caching**: Reduce API calls and improve performance with intelligent caching.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Easily debug and monitor your integrations.

## Benefits

- **Rapid Integration**: Implement new API connections in hours, not days or weeks.
- **Improved Performance**: Leverage async capabilities for efficient, non-blocking operations.
- **Clean Codebase**: Maintain consistent, asynchronous code across all your integrations.
- **Future-Proof**: We handle API changes and versioning, so you don't have to.
- **Open Source**: Benefit from community-driven development and transparency.
