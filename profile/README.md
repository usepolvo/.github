# üêô polvo

polvo is an open-source API integration toolkit that simplifies how developers interact with third-party services. Our mission is to streamline the process of integrating multiple APIs into your applications, allowing you to focus on building features rather than wrestling with integration complexities.

## üåü Key Features

- **Unified Async API Interface**: Interact with different APIs using a consistent, asynchronous pattern.
- **Smart Authentication**: Automatic handling of various authentication methods.
- **Intelligent Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limit handling and retry logic.
- **Universal Pagination**: Consistent data retrieval methods across different APIs.
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Common error types and handling across all integrations.
- **Webhook Management**: Unified webhook handling with built-in security features.
- **Efficient Caching**: Reduce API calls and improve performance.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Easily debug and monitor your integrations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install polvo:
   ```
   pip install usepolvo
   ```

2. Import the async client for your desired service:
   ```python
   from usepolvo.tentacles.stripe import StripeClient
   ```

3. Start making asynchronous API calls with a consistent, easy-to-use interface:
   ```python
   async with StripeClient() as client:
       customers = await client.customers.list()
   ```

## ü¶ë YATL: Yet Another Tentacle Language

YATL is our innovative, octopus-themed markup language designed for defining and managing state machines. It combines the simplicity of YAML with playful, octopus-inspired terminology to create an intuitive tool for describing complex state-based systems.

### Key Features of YATL

- **Intuitive Structure**: Uses a clear, hierarchical structure to define state machines.
- **Human-Readable**: Maintains a clean, indentation-based syntax similar to YAML.
- **Expressive**: Capable of describing complex state machines with detailed behaviors.
- **Event-Driven**: Supports event-based transitions between states.
- **Action-Oriented**: Allows definition of actions to be performed on entering or exiting states.

Learn more about YATL in our [YATL Documentation](https://docs.usepolvo.com/yatl).
